        <h1>Welcome to the Community Science Museum</h1>
        <p>Come join us at the Community Science Museum where we’re committed 
				to making science accessible to all. Over the course of human history, 
				science has developed from our early understanding of fire, wind, 
				water, and earth to exploring everything from galaxies far away to the 
				very building blocks of life itself. The aim of our museum is to create 
				a space where everyone can experience the wonders of
        our discoveries and perhaps even ignite a lifelong passion to 
				continue the exploration of the world around us. We believe science 
				should not be confined to the textbook, but brought to live through 
				exhibits. This is why we have over 1000 different exhibits on the many 
				varied subjects of science to explore. Many of these exhibits are 
				designed for you to interact with and play around to see science come 
				to life (apart from the dinosaur exhibits – they only come to life 
				at night when everyone’s gone home).</p>
