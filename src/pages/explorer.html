					<h2>Volunteer</h2>
					<p>A number of people volunteer their time and effort to keep the 
					displays in good order and ready for visitors to come and enjoy. 
					Volunteering has its perks including getting to see behind the scenes 
					of a working museum, access to staff-only lectures, and a monthly 
					lunch where all staff and volunteers come together to discuss ideas 
					for future exhibits and strategies for the museum. You can help 
					volunteer in a number of different spheres. Please contact us if 
					you’d like to find out more about how you can get involved.

          <h4>Energetica Exhibition on Loan</h4>
          <p>On loan from the NEMO Science Museum in Amsterdam, the Energetica 
					exhibition is coming to the Community Science Museum. It’s a series 
					of installations that allow visitors to experience the power of 
					the elements as we harness them. From solar energy powering lighting, 
					to ‘Wind Island’ that shows how turbines are able to use and control 
					wind to create power.
